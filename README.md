# Web Design
### Created a Website using `HTML`, `CSS` and `Bootstrap` using the data and analysis from a [previous project](https://github.com/gucaselo/python-api-challenge.git) where the weather from 500+ cities was evaluated to determine how weather changes with respect to the equator. 

The following scatter plots were used in the creation of this site:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
